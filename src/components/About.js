        Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Pillow and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently learning how to use html, css, javascript and more to customize and develope webpages. Moving forward I hope to learn how to incorporate these skills into learning other languages as well in order to better understand the abilities of coding as well as using this to bolster my ability to problem solve and create solutions for the ever growing need to understand technology in the present times. I'm looking forward to the road ahead and hope to see you all at the finish line.
