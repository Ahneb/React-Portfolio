## Description
This is a webpage made with React. It is a portfolio that is currently still under major construction. It has a navbar component that loads the other tabs as components as well. The nav items highlight when hovered and also changes colors when the tab is selected. Each tab brings you to another page (through changing the path name) without reloading the page.
